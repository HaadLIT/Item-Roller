# Item-Roller
A short program that you can run and see if you can drop any cool items. Press [1] to roll for a cool item &amp; [2] for a chance to re-roll that item for better luck. Press [1] again to start a new run.

This is a short pice of code I madea while back. It works all in the IDE its self. You hit launch and are prompted to enter 1 out of 2 options. You can either roll for an item or re-roll for an item. If you choose roll for an item you get the RNG chance of getting a cool item. If you re-roll you get a chance to re-roll the same item and see if you luck is any better; then the program ends. If you click one again it starts a new run all over. You can also just keep hitting option 2 to see what you get.
